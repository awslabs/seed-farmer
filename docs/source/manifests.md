# Manifests

The CLI is a module-centric deployment manager that follows the GitOps paradigm of code deployment.  Several manifests are required for deployment as defined below.

(deployment_manifest)=

## Deployment Manifest
The deployment manifest is the top level manifest and resides in the `modules` directory.  Below is an example deployment manifest. 

```yaml
name: examples
nameGenerator:
  prefix: myprefix
  suffix:
    valueFrom:
        envVariable: SUFFIX_ENV_VARIABLE

```

- **name** : this is the name of your deployment.  There can be only one deployment with this name in a project.
  - THIS CANNOT BE USED WITH `nameGenerator`
- **nameGenerator** : this supports dynamically generating a deployment name by concatenation of the following fields:
  - **prefix** - the prefix string of the name
  - **suffix** - the suffix string of the name
  - Both of these fields support the use of [Environment Variables](envVariable) (see example above)
  - THIS CANNOT BE USED WITH `name`
- **toolchainRegion** :the designated region that the `toolchain` is created in
- **forceDependencyRedeploy**: this is a boolean that tells seedfarmer to redeploy ALL dependency modules (see [Force Dependency Redeploy](force-redeploy)) - Default is `False`
- **archiveSecret**: name of a secret in SecretsManager that contains the credentials to access a private HTTPS archive for the modules
  - secret name must follow the `*-archive-credentials*` naming pattern
  - the secret value must be a JSON with the `username` and `password` values
- **groups** : the relative path to the [`module manifests`](module_manifest) that define each module in the group.  This sequential order is preserved in deployment, and reversed in destroy.
  - **name** - the name of the group
  - **path**- the relative path to the [module manifest](module_manifest)
  - **concurrency** - limit the number of concurrent codebuild jobs that run 
    - this is defaulted to the number of modules in the group
- **targetAccountMappings** - section defining target accounts and configurations, this is a list
  - **alias** - the logical name for an account, referenced by [`module manifests`](module_manifest)
  - **account** - the account id tied to the alias.  This parameter also supports [Environment Variables](envVariable)
  - **default** - this designates this mapping as the default account for all modules unless otherwise specified.  This is primarily for supporting migrating from `seedfarmer v1` to the current version.
  - **codebuildImage** - a custom build image to use (see [Build Image Override](buildimageoverride))
  - **npmMirror** - the NPM registry mirror to use (see [Mirror Override](mirroroverride))
  - **pypiMirror** - the Pypi mirror to use (see [Mirror Override](mirroroverride))
  - **pypiMirrorSecret** - the AWS SecretManager to use when setting the mirror (see [Mirror Override](mirroroverride))
  - **parametersGlobal** - these are parameters that apply to all region mappings unless otherwise overridden at the region level
    - **dockerCredentialsSecret** - please see [Docker Credentials Secret](dockerCredentialsSecret)
    - **permissionsBoundaryName** - the name of the [permissions boundary](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html) policy to apply to all module-specific roles created
  - **regionMappings** - section to define region-specific configurations for the defined account, this is a list
    - **region** - the region name
    - **default** - this designates this mapping as the default region for all modules unless otherwise specified.  This is primarily for supporting migrating
    - **codebuildImage** - a custom build image to use (see [Build Image Override](buildimageoverride))
    - **npmMirror** - the NPM registry mirror to use (see [Mirror Override](mirroroverride))
    - **pypiMirror** - the Pypi mirror to use (see [Mirror Override](mirroroverride))
    - **pypiMirrorSecret** - the AWS SecretManager to use when setting the mirror (see [Mirror Override](mirroroverride))
    - **parametersRegional** - these are parameters that apply to all region mappings unless otherwise overridden at the region level
      - **dockerCredentialsSecret** - please see [Docker Credentials Secret](dockerCredentialsSecret)
        - This is a NAMED PARAMETER...in that `dockerCredentialsSecret` is recognized by `seed-farmer`
      - **permissionsBoundaryName** - the name of the [permissions boundary](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html) policy to apply to all module-specific roles created
        - This is a NAMED PARAMETER...in that `permissionsBoundaryName` is recognized by `seed-farmer`
      - Any other parameter in this list is NOT a NAMED PARAMETER (ex. `vpcId`,`privateSubnetIds`,`publicSubnetIds`, etc,) and is solely for the use of lookup in:
        - module manifests
        - the `network` object in the `regionMappings` (see examples above)
    - **network** - this section indicates to `seed-farmer` and `aws-codeseeder` that the CodeBuild Project should be run in a VPC on Private Subnets.  This is to support compute resources in private or isolated subnets.  This CANNOT be changed once the `seedkit` is deployed (it either has VPC support or it does not).  ALL THREE parameters are required!
      - **vpcId** - the VPC ID the Codebuild Project should be associated to 
      - **privateSubnetIds** - the private subnets the Codebuild Project should be associated to 
      - **securityGroupIds** - the Security Groups the Codebuild Project should be associated to -- a limit of 5 is allowed

### Network Configuration for Regions
In the above section, we defined VPC support for deployments in CodeBuild.  The values can be hardcoded as denoted but also support:
- HardCoded Values
- Regional Parameters (see below for definition)
- AWS SSM Parameters (see below for definition) - NOTE: the SSM Parameter Name MUST start with the project name (the one in `seedfarmer.yaml`)
- Environment Variables (see below for definition)
  

There are a couple of things to be aware of:
1. The three values (vpcId, privateSubnetIds, securityGroupIds) should be stored as a string (if a vpcId) or stringified JSON lists (if privateSubnetIds or securityGroupIds).  **SeedFarmer predominantly leverages JSON as strings stored in SSM - these values are no different**.
2. Each value is defined independently - and is in no way linked to the other two.  It is up to you (the end user) to make sure the Subnets / Security Groups are in the proper VPC.  SeedFarmer does NOT validate this prior, and the deployment will error out with an ugly stack trace.

Let's look as some examples
#### HardCoded Value Support for Network
  ```yaml
network: 
  vpcId: vpc-XXXXXXXXX    
  privateSubnetIds:
    - subnet-XXXXXXXXX
    - subnet-XXXXXXXXX
  securityGroupsIds:
    - sg-XXXXXXXXX
  ```


#### Regional Parameters Support for Network
See the [above code snippets](deployment_manifest)
```yaml
network: 
  vpcId:
    valueFrom:
      parameterValue: vpcId
  privateSubnetIds:
    valueFrom:
      parameterValue: privateSubnetIds
  securityGroupIds:
    valueFrom:
      parameterValue: securityGroupIds
```


#### AWS SSM Parameters Support for Network
This cannot be stressed enough: **the SSM Parameter Name MUST start with the project name**. For example: if the name of your project is `idf` as defined in `seedfarmer.yaml`, then your SSM Parameter name MUST start with `/idf/`.  If you do not leverage this info, then your deployment will NOT have access to the SSM Parameter.

This value is account/region-specific.  In other words, for every target account/region, you MUST populate this SSM Parameter if it is defined the the `deployment manifest`.  This is NOT a global value.

Here is an example.  Let's assume my project name is `idf`
```yaml
network: 
  vpcId: 
    valueFrom:
      parameterStore: /idf/testing/vpcid
  privateSubnetIds:
    valueFrom:
      parameterStore: /idf/testing/privatesubnets
  securityGroupIds:
    valueFrom:
      parameterStore: /idf/testing/securitygroups
```
The corresponding SSM Parameters would look like:
```code
/idf/testing/vpcid --> "vpc-0c4cb9e06c9413222"
/idf/testing/privatesubnets --> ["subnet-0c36d3d5808f67a02","subnet-00fa1e71cddcf57d3"]
/idf/testing/securitygroups --> ["sg-049033188c114a3d2"]
```
*** NOTE the lists above!!

#### Environment Variable Support for Network
Here is an example:
```yaml
network: 
  vpcId: 
    valueFrom:
      envVariable: VPCID
  privateSubnetIds:
    valueFrom:
      envVariable: PRIVATESUBNETS
  securityGroupIds:
    valueFrom:
      envVariable: SECURITYGROUPS
```
The corresponding `.env` file would have the following defined (again, remember the lists!!):
```bash
VPCID="vpc-0c4cb9e06c9413222"
PRIVATESUBNETS='["subnet-0c36d3d5808f67a02","subnet-00fa1e71cddcf57d3"]'
SECURITYGROUPS='["sg-049033188c114a3d2"]'
```
(dependency-management)=
### Dependency Management

SeedFarmer has a shared-responsibilty model for dependency management of modules.  We have put in guardrails within SeedFarmer to inspect your deployment manifest prior to deployment ( ex. we prevent deletion of modules that have downstream modules dependent on it, prevent circular references of modules, etc.), but it is up to the end user to be aware of and manage the relationships between modules to assess impact of changes to modules via redeployment.  If a module is rendered into an inoperable state (ex. a rollback of CloudFormation prevents a ChangeSet from occurring), the user is responsible for resolving any blockers due to an inoperable change incurred by a failed module deployment.


(force-redeploy)=
#### Force Dependency Redeploy

We recommend to destroy / deploy / redeploy modules explicitly via the manifests.

But, we understand that sometimes when a module changes (is redeployed), the other downstream modules that are dependent on it may want to consume those changes. This flag will tell SeedFarmer to force a redeploy of all modules impacted by the redeploy of another module.  This is an indiscriminant feature in that it is not granular enough to detect WHAT is causing a redeploy, only that one needs to occur.

What does this mean?  Well, let's take the following module deployment order: 
```code
 Module-A --> Module-B --> Module-C --> Module-D --> Module-E 
```
 In this scenario, all modules are in their own group and the order of groups is as indicated.  
 `Module-D` is ONLY using metadata from `Module-C`, which is using metadata from `Module-A`.  In other words, `Module-D` has a dependency on  `Module-C` and `Module-C` has a dependency on `Module-A`.  **`Module-D` DOES NOT have a direct dependency on `Module-A`, but will be forced to redeploy because of the direct dependency on `Module-C`**  When the `forceDependencyRedeploy` flag is set, ANY change to `Module-A` will trigger a redeploy of `Module-A`, then in turn force a redeploy of `Module-C` and then force a redeployment of `Module-D`.   `Modules-B` and `Module-E` are unaffected.
 
 **This is an important feature to understand: redeployment is not discriminant.**  SeedFarmer does not know how to assess what has changed in a module and its impact on downstream modules.  Nor does it have the ability to know if a module can incur a redeployment (as opposed to a destroy and deploy process).  That is up to you to determine with respect to the modules you are leveraging.  ANY change to the source code (deployspec, modulestack, comments in cdk code, etc.) will indicate to SeedFarmer that the module needs to be redeployed, even if the underlying logic / artifact has not changed.  

 Also, it is important to understand that this feature could put your deployment in an unusable state if the shared-responsibility model is not followed.
 For example: let's say a deployment has a module (called `networking`) that deploys a VPC with public and private subnets that are restricted to a particular CIDR (as input).  Then, downstream modules reference the metadata of `networking`.  If a user were to change the CIDR references and redeploy the `networking` module, this has the potential to render the deployment in an unusable state: the process to change the CIDR's would trigger a destroy of the existing subnets...which would fail due to resources from other modules leveraging those subnets.  The redeployment would fail, and the user would have to manually correct the state.

(module_manifest)=
## Module Manifest

The module manifest is referred to by the [deployment manifest](deployment_manifest) and defines the information the CLI needs to deploy a module or a group of modules - as defined by the group.  Each entry in the module manifest is deployed in parallel and ordering is not preserved.
```yaml
name: networking
path: modules/optionals/networking/
targetAccount: primary
parameters:
  - name: internet-accessible
    value: true
---
name: buckets
path: modules/optionals/buckets
targetAccount: secondary
targetRegion: us-west-2
codebuildImage:  XXXXXXXXXXXX.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/aws-codeseeder/code-build-base:3.3.0
npmMirror: https://registry.npmjs.org/
pypiMirror: https://pypi.python.org/simple
pypiMirrorSecret: /something/aws-addf-mirror-secret
parameters:
  - name: encryption-type
    value: SSE
  - name: some-name
    valueFrom:
      moduleMetadata:
        group: optionals
        name: networking
        key: VpcId
dataFiles:
  - filePath: data/test2.txt
  - filePath: test1.txt
  - filePath: git::https://github.com/awslabs/idf-modules.git//modules/storage/buckets/deployspec.yaml?ref=release/1.0.0&depth=1
  - filePath: archive::https://github.com/awslabs/idf-modules/archive/refs/tags/v1.6.0.tar.gz?module=modules/storage/buckets/deployspec.yaml
```
- **name** - the name of the module
  - this name must be unique in the group of the deployment
- **path** - this element supports two sources of code:
  - the relative path to the module code in the project if deploying code from the local filesystem
  - a public Git Repository, leveraging the Terraform semantic as denoted [HERE](https://www.terraform.io/language/modules/sources#generic-git-repository)
  - a release archive to download over HTTPS 
- **targetAccount** - the alias of the account from the [deployment manifest mappings](deployment_manifest)
- **targetRegion** - the name of the region to deploy to - this overrides any mappings
- **codebuildImage** - a custom build image to use (see [Build Image Override](buildimageoverride))
- **npmMirror** - the NPM registry mirror to use (see [Mirror Override](mirroroverride))
- **pypiMirror** - the Pypi mirror to use (see [Mirror Override](mirroroverride))
- **pypiMirrorSecret** - the AWS SecretManager to use when setting the mirror (see [Mirror Override](mirroroverride))
- **parameters** - the parameters section .... see [Parameters](parameters)
- **dataFiles** - additional files to add to the bundle that are outside of the module code
  - this is LIST and EVERY element in the list must have the keyword **filePath**
  - the **filePath** does support pulls from Git Repository, leveraging the Terraform semantic as denoted [HERE](https://www.terraform.io/language/modules/)

Here is a sample manifest referencing a git repo:
```yaml
name: networking
path: git::https://github.com/awslabs/idf-modules.git//modules/network/basic-cdk?ref=release/1.0.0&depth=1
targetAccount: secondary
parameters:
  - name: internet-accessible
    value: true
```

Here is a sample manifest referencing an archive over HTTPS:
```yaml
name: networking
path: archive::https://github.com/awslabs/idf-modules/archive/refs/tags/v1.6.0.tar.gz?module=modules/network/basic-cdk
targetAccount: secondary
parameters:
  - name: internet-accessible
    value: true
```

### A Word About DataFiles ###
The **dataFile** support for modules is intended to take a file(s) located outside of the module code and packaged them as if they were a part of the module.  The use case: there are data files that are shared amongst multiple modules, or are dynamic and can change over time.  As you leverage the Git Path functionality (for sourcing modules in manifest), being able to modify these data files would have meant a change to the module code - which is not feasible as it will cause all deployments that leverage the same code to redeploy.

This feature will allow you to stage files locally in your SeedFarmer Project (MUST be located relative to `seedfarmer.yaml`) or are contained in a Git Repository.  These files will be packaged UNDER the module when deploying as if they are part of the module code.  The relative paths remain intact UNDER the module when packaged.  

When using this feature, any change to these file(s) (modifying, add to manifest, removing from manifest) will indicate to SeedFarmer that a redeployment is necessary.

***Iceburg, dead ahead!*** Heres the rub: if you deploy with data files sourced from a local filesystem, you MUST provide those same files in order to destroy the module(s)...we are not keeping them stored anywhere (much like the module source code).  ***Iceburg  missed us! (why is everything so wet??)***

(universaloverride)=
## Universal Environment Variable Replacement in Manifests
As of the release of `seed-farmer==3.5.0`, we have added support for dynamic replacement of values with environment variables in manifests.  This does not replace any pre-existing functionality.  This also is limited to only manifests (`deployment_manifest` and `module_manifest`).  Things like the `deployspec` and the `modulestack` are NOT included in this functionality.  We strongly recommend using hard-coded values in manifests or leveraging the facilities already in place, but we have added this feature based on feedback from experienced users.

Any string within your manifests that has a designated pattern will automatically be resolved.  If you have an environment variable named `SOMEKEY` that is defined, you can reference it in your manifests via wrapping it in `${}` --> for example `${SOMEKEY}`.   

The following is a valid manifest:

```yaml
name: dummy
path: git::https://github.com/awslabs/idf-modules.git//modules/dummy/blank?ref=release/1.2.0
targetAccount: primary
targetRegion: us-east-1
parameters:
  - name: test
    value: hiyooo
  - name:  myparamkey
    valueFrom:
      parameterStore: /idf/${SOMEKEY}/somekey
  - name: test2
    value: ${SOMEKEY}
  - name: private-subnet-ids
    valueFrom:
      moduleMetadata:
        group: optionals
        name: networking
        key: PrivateSubnetIds
  - name: vpc-id
    valueFrom:
      secretsManager: ${SOMEKEY}
```
This can be applied to all values in the manifest.  We do not recommend using this in the `name` field of manifests as any value that is referenced by downstream manifests MUST align.  For example, in the following:

```yaml
name: ${SOMEKEY}
path: git::https://github.com/awslabs/idf-modules.git//modules/dummy/blank?ref=release/1.2.0
targetAccount: primary
targetRegion: us-east-1
```

This can be done, but is strongly discouraged as the need to align all modules that refer to this module MUST use the same environment key (`SOMEKEY`).  That responsibility is on the user to manage.



(buildimageoverride)=
## Codebuild Image Override
An AWS Codebuild complaint image is provided for use with `seed-farmer` and we recommend using it as-is (no need to leverage the `codebuildImage` manifest named paramter).  But, we get it....no one wants to be boxed in.</br>

<b>USER BEWARE</b> - this is a feature meant for advanced users...use at own risk!
  
Users can override the default build image via one of the following:
- an AWS Curated Build Image
- a custom-built image 

#### AWS Curated Build Images
There are multiple [build images and available runtimes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/available-runtimes.html) that are supported by AWS Codebuild.  For `seed-farmer`, we currently support the following AWS Curated Images with the default runtimes installed:

| AWS Curated Build Image | Confgured Runtimes|
| ----------- | ----------- |    
|aws/codebuild/standard:6.0|nodejs:16|
||python:3.10|
||java:corretto17|
|aws/codebuild/standard:7.0|nodejs:18|
||python:3.11|
||java:corretto21|

#### Custom Build Images
If an end user wants to build their own image, it is STRONGLY encouraged to use [this Dockerfile from AWS public repos](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-codeseeder/blob/main/images/code-build-image/Dockerfile) as the base layer.  `seed-farmer` leverages this as the base for its default image ([see HERE](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-codeseeder/blob/main/images/code-build-image/Dockerfile)).  It is up to the module developer to verify all proper libraries are installed and available.

### Logic for Rules -- Application
There are three (3) places to configure a custom build image:
- at the module level
- at the account/region mapping level
- at the account level

`seed-farmer` is an module-centric deployment framework.  You CAN have a custom image configured at each of the levels defined above, and the following logic is applied:
1. if the image is defined at the module level --- USE IT... ELSE
2. if the image is defined at the account/region level --- USE IT... ELSE
3. if the image is defined at the account level --- USE IT... ELSE
4. use the default image 


(mirroroverride)=
## Mirror Overrides
 `seed-farmer`  is python based and uses Pypi for code distribution.  In some cases, you may want to override the default mirror / registry that `seed-farmer` uses to pull in supporting artifacts like `AWS-CodeSeeder` and AWS-CLI for NPM.  For example, when running in the China partition, a mirror is very helpful. `seed-farmer` supports mirror configuration.  Like the codebuild image, there is a level of logic that is followed:
1. if a mirror is defined at the module level --- USE IT... ELSE
2. if a mirror is defined at the account/region level --- USE IT... ELSE
3. if a mirror is defined at the account level --- USE IT... ELSE
4. no mirror is set

### Mirror Secrets
If using a Pypi-compliant mirror that is not public or needs an authentication scheme, the `pypiMirrorSecret` provides a means to set a username / password (or user / token) in the global definition of the AWS Codebuild runtime.  To use this feature, you MUST adhere to the following:
1. Be sure to have `seed-farmer` version >= 3.5.0 and have properly updated if migrating from an older version
2. have an AWS SecretsManager set in EACH account/region combination that you want to leverage it (the user MUST set this up prior to using)
3. the content of the AWS SecretsManager adheres to the format defined below
4. the name of the AWS SecretsManager adheres to the format defined below
5. a `pypiMirror` is defined at the SAME LEVEL in the manifest

The `pypiMirrorSecret` feature can support multiple entries for use.  It is NOT part of the calculation for redeploy (ie. you can change it at will and it will not force a redeploy of any module referencing it - to allow updates and additions over time).  

The AWS SecretManager name must follow the following pattern (NO exceptions):
```code
*-mirror-credentials*
```
Here are some examples of valid names:
- /aws-addf-mirror-credentials
- /something/important/hey-mirror-credentials

Here are some names that are in-valid
- /aws-addfmirror-credentials
- /something/important/mirror-credentials

The content of the AWS SecretsManager allows multiple entries to support different configuratons.  It MUST be a JSON dict of dict, where each top-level dict is the name of the key-par and its child elements contain `username` and `password` keys.  Let's look at an example of a value payload:

```json
{
  "pypi": { 
    "username": "derekpypi", 
    "password": "thepasswordpypi" 
  },
  "artifactory": {
    "username": "myuser@amazon.com",
    "password": "agobbleygookofahexcodehere"
  },
  "pypi2": { 
    "username": "hey", 
    "password": "yooooo" 
  },
}
```
This example has valid entries.  The default key is `pypi`.  In order to leverage this scheme, a particular pattern MUST be followed in your manifest under the `pypiMirrorSecret` key: `name-of-secret::name-of-key`.  The `::` indicates to `seed-farmer` and `AWS-CodeSeeder` what username/password combination to use.  

Let's walk through an example.  Assume that the previous example of a secret payload is set and the secret name is `/aws-addf-mirror-credentials`.  I want to use the `artifactory` username/password entry.  My manifest would look like the following:
```yaml
...
pypiMirror: https://the-mirror-dns/simple/pypi
pypiMirrorSecret: /aws-addf-mirror-credentials::artifactory
...

```
This would result in the creation of the url `https://myuser@amazon.com:agobbleygookofahexcodehere@the-mirror-dns/simple/pypi` and the global config in the runtime will be set via:

```code
pip config set global.index-url https://myuser@amazon.com:agobbleygookofahexcodehere@the-mirror-dns/simple/pypi

```

If I wanted to user the default `pypi` entry, my manifest would look like:
```yaml
...
pypiMirror: https://the-mirror-dns/simple/pypi
pypiMirrorSecret: /aws-addf-mirror-credentials
...

```
This would result in the creation of the url `https://derekpypi:thepasswordpypi@the-mirror-dns/simple/pypi` and the global config in the runtime will be set via:
```code
pip config set global.index-url https://derekpypi:thepasswordpypi@the-mirror-dns/simple/pypi
```

### Archive Secret

If using an archive store that is not public or needs an authentication scheme, the `archiveSecret` provides a means to set a username / password, so that the archived modules can be downloaded.

To use this feature, you MUST adhere to the following:
1. Be sure to have `seed-farmer` version >= 5.0.0 and have properly updated if migrating from an older version
2. have an AWS SecretsManager secret in the tool chain account and region (the user MUST set this up prior to using)
3. the content of the AWS SecretsManager adheres to the format defined below
4. the name of the AWS SecretsManager adheres to the format defined below

The AWS SecretManager name must follow the following pattern (NO exceptions):
```code
*-archive-credentials*
```
Here are some examples of valid names:
- `/aws-addf-archive-credentials`
- `/something/important/hey-archive-credentials`

Here are some names that are in-valid
- `/aws-addfarchive-credentials`
- `/something/important/archive-credentials`

The content of the AWS SecretsManager secret must be a JSON containing two values: `username` and `password`.  Let's look at an example of a value payload:

```json
{
  "username": "archive-user", 
  "password": "archive-password" 
},
```

(parameters)=
## Parameters

Parameters are defined in the [Module Manifests](module_manifest) as Key/Value pairs.  On deployment, values are serialized to JSON and passed to the module’s CodeBuild execution as Environment Variables. 

Modules should be parameterized to promote extensibility.  The CLI and [Module Manifests](module_manifest) support parameters of multiple types:
- [User Defined](user_defined) - a simple key/value string
- [Module Metadata](modulemetadata) from other deployed modules
- [Global and Regional Parameters](globalregionalparameters)  
- [Environment Variables](envVariable)
- [AWS SSM Parameter](ssm_parameter)
- [AWS Secrets Manager](secrets_manager)

They are defined in the module manifest for each module.

(user_defined)=
### User-Defined
These are simple key/value pairs passed in as strings.  Here is an example of a module with user-defined parameters:
```yaml
name: metadata-storage
path: modules/core/metadata-storage/
parameters:
  - name: glue-db-suffix
    value: vsidata
  - name: rosbag-bagfile-table-suffix
    value: Rosbag-BagFile-Metadata
  - name: rosbag-scene-table-suffix
    value: Rosbag-Scene-Metadata
```
In this example, the `glue-db-suffix` parameter will be exposed to the CodeBuild via AWS CodeSeeder as an [environment parameter](params_in_codeseeder).



(envVariable)=
### Environment Variables
`SeedFarmer` supports using [Dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv) for dynamic replacement.  When a file named `.env` is placed at the projecr root (where `seedfarmer.yaml` resides), any value in a manifest with a key of `envVariable` will be matched and replaced with the corresponding environment variable.  You can pass in overriding `.env` files by using the `--env-file` on CLI command invocation.

`SeedFarmer` also supports passing multiple `.env`, by using `--env-file` multiple times. For example: `seedfarmer apply --env-file .env.shared --env-file .env.secret`. If the same value is present in multiple `.env` files, subsequent files will override the value from the previous one. In the aforementioned example, values from `.env.secret` will override values from `.env.shared`.

```yaml
name: opensearch
path: modules/core/opensearch/
parameters:
  - name: vpc-id
    valueFrom:
      envVariable: ENV_VPC_ID
```
In this example, the `opensearch` module is referencing an environment parameter named `ENV_VPC_ID`. <br>

The `opensearch` module deployment will then have an environment parameter set in the environment to the value of the parameter.  It can then be referenced as an [environment parameter](params_in_codeseeder) in the deployment.

`Environment Variables` also support dynamically changing the `account_id` in manifests to avoid hard-coding an `account_id` in any manifest.
```yaml
accountId:
  valueFrom:
    envVariable: PRIMARY_ACCOUNT
```
<br>

(modulemetadata)=
### Module Metadata
Parameters can leverage exported metadata from existing modules.  You will need to know the group name, module name and the name of the parameter.  It leverages the `valueFrom` keyword and has a nested definiton. Below is an example:
```yaml
name: opensearch
path: modules/core/opensearch/
parameters:
  - name: vpc-id
    valueFrom:
      moduleMetadata:
        group: optionals
        name: networking
        key: VpcId
```
In this example, the `opensearch` module is referencing a module metadata parameter `VpcId` from the `networking` module in the `optionals` group. <br>

The `opensearch` module deployment will then have an environment parameter set in the environment to the value of the vpc-id that is exported from the `networking` module.  They can then be referenced as an [environment parameter](params_in_codeseeder) in the deployment.


(globalregionalparameters)=
### Global and Regional Parameters
Global and Regional Parameters are simple name/value pairs that can be defined and are applied to the account referenced in their affiliated sections.  The Global Parameters are available to all regions in the defiend account  The Regional Parameters are available in the region they are defined in.
```yaml
targetAccountMappings:
  - alias: primary
    accountId: 123456789012
    default: true
    parametersGlobal:
      dockerCredentialsSecret: nameofsecret
      permissionsBoundaryName: policyname
      mygreatkey: mygreatvalue
    regionMappings:
      - region: us-east-2
        default: true
        parametersRegional:
          dockerCredentialsSecret: nameofsecret
          permissionsBoundaryName: policyname
          vpcId: vpc-XXXXXXXXX
          publicSubnetIds:
            - subnet-XXXXXXXXX
            - subnet-XXXXXXXXX
          privateSubnetIds:
            - subnet-XXXXXXXXX
            - subnet-XXXXXXXXX
          isolatedSubnetIds:
            - subnet-XXXXXXXXX
            - subnet-XXXXXXXXX
          securityGroupsId:
            - sg-XXXXXXXXX
```
In the above example, the Global and Regional Parameters are defined (ex. `mygreatkey` in Global and `privateSubnetIds` in Regional).  They can be referenced by a module in the module manifest using the `parameterValue` keyword:

```yaml
name: efs
path: modules/core/efs/
parameters:
  - name: vpc-id
    valueFrom:
      parameterValue: vpcId
  - name: removal-policy
    value: DESTROY
  - name: testitout
    valueFrom:
      parameterValue: mygreatkey
```
`seed-farmer` will first look in the Regional Parameters for a matching key, and return a string object (all json convert to a string) represening the value.  If not found, `seed-farrmer` will look in the Global Parameters for the same key and return that string-ified value.

NOTE: the `network` section of the [deployment manifest](deployment_manifest) leverages Regional Parameters only!

(ssm_parameter)=
### AWS SSM Parameter
Parameters can leverage key/value pairs stored in [AWS SSM Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html).  You will need to know the name of the parameter.  It leverages the `valueFrom` keyword and has a nested definiton. Below is an example:
```yaml
name: opensearch
path: modules/core/opensearch/
parameters:
  - name: vpc-id
    valueFrom:
      parameterStore: my-vpc-id
```
In this example, the `opensearch` module is referencing an SSM parameter named `my-vpc-id` from AWS SSM Parameter Store. <br>

The `opensearch` module deployment will then have an environment parameter set in the environment to the value of the parameter that is fetched.  It can then be referenced as an [environment parameter](params_in_codeseeder) in the deployment.

`SeedFarmer` will respect changes to the SSM parameter via versioning.  If a module is deployed with an SSM Parameter, and then that parameter value is changed (invoking a version change of the parameter), `SeedFarmer` will detect that change and redeploy the module.  

NOTE: AWS CodeBuild does not currently respect passing in versions, so you cannot pass in a particular version in the manifest.  In other words, passing in `my-vpc-id:3` as a value for `parameterStore` will cause a failure.

(secrets_manager)=
### AWS SecretsManager
Parameters can leverage secured secrets in [AWS Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html).  You will need to know the name of the secret.  It leverages the `valueFrom` keyword and has a nested definiton. Below is an example:
```yaml
name: opensearch
path: modules/core/opensearch/
parameters:
  - name: vpc-id
    valueFrom:
      secretsManager: my-secret-vpc-id
```
In this example, the `opensearch` module is referencing a secret named `my-secret-vpc-id` from AWS Secrets Manager. <br>

The `opensearch` module deployment will then have an environment parameter set in the environment to the value of the secret that is fetched.  It can then be referenced as an [environment parameter](params_in_codeseeder) in the deployment.  NOTE: the value will be obfusticated in the AWS CodeBuild console in the Environments Section for security purposes.

`SeedFarmer` will respect changes to the SecretsManager secret via version-id and version-stage.  If the version-id referenced has changed, `SeedFarmer` will detect and indicate a redeploy of the module(s) that refer to that secret. 

NOTE: AWS CodeBuild does currently respect passing in version-id and version-stage, as defined in the [documentation HERE](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec.env.secrets-manager).  If no version-stage or version-id is passed in, then we will look for the version-id corresponding to the version-stage of `AWSCURRENT`. 


(dockerCredentialsSecret)=
### Docker Credentials Secret
A named manifest key pointing to an [AWS Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html) entry that is use by AWS CodeSeeder when building images to prevent throttling from publically hosted image repositories such as DockerHub. <br>
<br>
The data in the SecretsManager is a json element of the following format:
  ```json
  {
    "docker.io": {
      "username": "username",
      "password": "thepassword"
    }
  }
  ```

  (params_in_codeseeder)=
### Parameters in AWS CodeSeeder

CodeBuild Environment Variables that are set via AWS CodeSeeder are made known to the module using a naming convention based off the Parameter’s key. Parameter keys are converted from “PascalCase”, “camelCase”, or “kebab-case” to all upper “SNAKE_CASE” and prefixed with “<<project>>_PARAMETER_”.  If the name of our project is "MY_APP" the resulting environment parameters will be:

``` 
* someKey will become environment variable MYAPP_PARAMETER_SOME_KEY
* SomeKey will become environment variable MYAPP_PARAMETER_SOME_KEY
* some-key will become environment variable MYAPP_PARAMETER_SOME_KEY
* some_key will become environment variable MYAPP_PARAMETER_SOME_KEY
* somekey will become environment variable MYAPP_PARAMETER_SOMEKEY
```
