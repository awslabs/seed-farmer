An `AWS Professional Service <https://aws.amazon.com/professional-services>`_ open source initiative | aws-proserve-opensource@amazon.com


Seed-Farmer
==============
**Seed-Farmer** is an opensource orchestration tool that works with `AWS CodeSeeder <https://github.com/awslabs/aws-codeseeder>`_ and acts as an orchestration tool modeled after `GitOps deployments <https://www.gitops.tech/>`_ .  
It has a CommandLine Interface (CLI) based in Python. 

**Seed-Farmer** leverages modular code deployments (`see modules <module_development.html>`_) leveraging `manifests <manifests.html>`_ and `deployspecs <deployspec.html>`_, keeping track of changes and applying changes as need / detected.
